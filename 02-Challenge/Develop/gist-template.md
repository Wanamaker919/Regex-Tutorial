 Project #17: Computer Science for JavaScript - Regex Tutorial

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)

Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will explore a specific regular expression 
and break down each part of the expression to understand what it does. Regular expressions, 
also known as regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation.

## Summary

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. 
Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

In this tutorial, we will be focusing on the regular expression for matching an email address:

```javascript
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/


Table of Contents
Component 1: Start and End Anchors (^ and $)
Component 2: Username Part ([a-z0-9_.-]+)
Component 3: Domain Part ([\da-z.-]+)
Component 4: Top-Level Domain ([a-z.]{2,6})
Component 1: Start and End Anchors (^ and $)
The regular expression starts and ends with the caret (^) and dollar sign ($) symbols, respectively. 
These symbols represent anchors that ensure the regex matches the entire input string, from start to end.

Code snippet:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
Example:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.test('example@example.com'); // true


Component 2: Username Part ([a-z0-9_.-]+)
The username part of the email address is captured by the first group in the regex: ([a-z0-9_\.-]+). 
This part allows lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), dots (.), and hyphens (-) in the username. 
The plus sign (+) ensures that at least one character is required.

Code snippet:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
Example:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.test('example123@example.com'); // true


Component 3: Domain Part ([\da-z.-]+)
The domain part of the email address is captured by the second group in the regex: ([\da-z\.-]+). 
This part allows lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), dots (.), hyphens (-), and underscores (_) in the domain name. 
The plus sign (+) ensures that at least one character is required.

Code snippet:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
Example:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.test('example@example.com'); // true


Component 4: Top-Level Domain ([a-z.]{2,6})
The top-level domain part of the email address is captured by the third group in the regex: ([a-z\.]{2,6}). 
This part allows lowercase letters (a-z) and dots (.) in the top-level domain. 
The {2,6} quantifier specifies that the top-level domain must consist of 2 to 6 characters.

Code snippet:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
Example:

javascript
Copy code
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.test('example@example.com'); // true
